Display references such as clients, festivals and awards in a structured, chronological format.

## Description

The **GatherPress References** block displays a generated list of references from past events. It automatically organizes references by year and type (e.g., clients, festivals, awards).

This plugin requires the GatherPress plugin to be installed and activated. It works with GatherPress events (`gatherpress_event` post type) to provide specialized reference management for theater productions and similar use cases.

Perfect for creating dynamic reference pages, portfolios, and annual summaries of achievements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does this plugin work without GatherPress?

No, this plugin is specifically designed as a GatherPress add-on and requires GatherPress to be installed and activated. It extends GatherPress functionality to add reference management.

### What taxonomies does this plugin create?

By default, the plugin registers four custom taxonomies associated with the GatherPress `gatherpress_event` post type:
- `gatherpress-production`: Hierarchical taxonomy for productions (the default reference taxonomy)
- `_gatherpress-client`: Clients
- `_gatherpress-festival`: Festival participations
- `_gatherpress-award`: Awards received

These work alongside GatherPress's existing event taxonomies and can be customized via post type support configuration.

### Can I use this plugin with regular WordPress posts?

Yes! While designed for GatherPress events, the plugin works with any post type. Add support using `add_post_type_support()` with your desired taxonomies. See Example 8 and 9 for complete code examples.

### Can I use GatherPress's built-in taxonomies (Topics and Venues)?

Absolutely! Examples 6 and 7 show how to leverage GatherPress's native Topics and Venues taxonomies for powerful event organization and reference displays.

### Can I show only awards for a specific production?

Yes. Use the block settings to select a specific production and set the type filter to **Awards**.

### Does it work automatically on reference term archive pages?

Yes. When placed on a reference taxonomy term archive, the block automatically detects the term context and shows only its references.

### How do I customize the block's appearance?

The block supports **theme.json** styling:

- Colors (background, text, links)  
- Typography (font family, size, line height)  
- Spacing (margin, padding, block gap)  
- Borders (color, radius, width)  

You can also use custom CSS:

- `.wp-block-gatherpress-references` - Main container
- `.references-year` - Year headings
- `.references-type` - Type headings
- `.references-list` - Reference lists

### Can I change the heading levels?

Yes. The block includes a **Year Heading Level** control in the block settings. You can set year headings to **H1–H5**, and type headings will automatically be one level smaller.

### Can I change the year sort order?

Yes. The block includes a **Sort Years** toggle control. By default, years are sorted newest first (descending). Toggle it on to sort from oldest to newest (ascending). This control only appears when showing all years (no specific year filter).

### How do I add demo data for testing?

The Playground contains a [Demo Data Generator](https://gist.github.com/carstingaxion/fd8b833d935f69b23e6a081b12a5937a), that can be used to create a bunch of real data to test the plugin.

Go to **Events → Demo Data** in the WordPress admin and click **Generate Demo Data** to create:

- 5 theater productions  
- 20 GatherPress event posts  
- 8 client terms  
- 6 festival terms  
- 6 award terms  

All demo data is marked for easy cleanup via the **Delete Demo Data** button.

### Does this affect my existing GatherPress events?

No, this plugin only adds optional taxonomies to GatherPress events. Your existing events remain unchanged unless you explicitly assign the new taxonomy terms to them.

## Developer Documentation

### GatherPress Integration

The plugin extends GatherPress by registering taxonomies and using post type support for configuration:

```php
// Configure which taxonomies to use via post type support
$config = array(
    'ref_tax'   => 'gatherpress-production',  // The main reference taxonomy
    'ref_types' => array( '_gatherpress-client', '_gatherpress-festival', '_gatherpress-award' ),
);
add_post_type_support( 'gatherpress_event', 'gatherpress_references', $config );
```

### Block Attributes

```json
{
  "refTermId": {
    "type": "number",
    "default": 0
  },
  "year": {
    "type": "number",
    "default": 0
  },
  "referenceType": {
    "type": "string",
    "default": "all",
    "enum": ["all", "ref_client", "ref_festival", "ref_award"]
  },
  "headingLevel": {
    "type": "number",
    "default": 2
  },
  "yearSortOrder": {
    "type": "string",
    "default": "desc",
    "enum": ["asc", "desc"]
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategy

The plugin uses WordPress transients for performance:

```php
// Cache key based on filter parameters
$cache_key = 'gatherpress_refs_' . md5(serialize([
    $ref_term_id,
    $year,
    $type
]));

// Try to get cached data
$cached = get_transient($cache_key);
if (false !== $cached) {
    return $cached;
}

// ... perform query ...

// Cache results for 1 hour
set_transient($cache_key, $references, 3600);
```

**Cache Invalidation:**
Cache is automatically cleared when:
- Event posts are saved or deleted
- Taxonomy terms are edited or deleted
- Demo data is generated or deleted

### Data Organization

Results are organized and cached in a nested structure:

```php
[
    '2024' => [
        '_gatherpress-client' => ['Client 1', 'Client 2'],
        '_gatherpress-festival' => ['Festival 1'],
        '_gatherpress-award' => ['Award 1', 'Award 2']
    ],
    '2023' => [
        '_gatherpress-client' => ['Client 3'],
        '_gatherpress-festival' => [],
        '_gatherpress-award' => ['Award 3']
    ]
]
```

### Filter Hooks Reference

The plugin provides several filter hooks for customization:

#### `gatherpress_references_cache_expiration`

**Description:** Modify the cache expiration time in seconds.

**Default:** 3600 (1 hour)

**Parameters:**
- `$seconds` (int) - Cache expiration time in seconds

**Example - Increase cache to 2 hours:**
```php
add_filter( 'gatherpress_references_cache_expiration', function( $seconds ) {
    return 7200; // 2 hours
} );
```

**Example - Disable caching:**
```php
add_filter( 'gatherpress_references_cache_expiration', '__return_zero' );
```

---

#### `gatherpress_references_query_args`

**Description:** Modify WP_Query arguments before the query is executed.

**Parameters:**
- `$args` (array) - WP_Query arguments array
- `$ref_term_id` (int) - Reference term ID filter
- `$year` (string) - Year filter
- `$type` (string) - Reference type filter

**Example - Limit results to 50 posts:**
```php
add_filter( 'gatherpress_references_query_args', function( $args ) {
    $args['posts_per_page'] = 50;
    return $args;
} );
```

**Example - Add custom meta query:**
```php
add_filter( 'gatherpress_references_query_args', function( $args ) {
    $args['meta_query'] = array(
        array(
            'key'     => 'featured',
            'value'   => '1',
            'compare' => '='
        )
    );
    return $args;
} );
```

**Example - Conditional ordering:**
```php
add_filter( 'gatherpress_references_query_args', function( $args, $ref_term_id, $year, $type ) {
    // Order by title alphabetically for award references
    if ( $type === '_gatherpress-award' ) {
        $args['orderby'] = 'title';
        $args['order'] = 'ASC';

#### `gatherpress_references_type_labels`

**Description:** Customize the human-readable labels for each reference type displayed in headings.

**Default:**
```php
array(
    '_gatherpress-client'    => __( 'Clients', 'gatherpress-references' ),
    '_gatherpress-festival' => __( 'Festivals', 'gatherpress-references' ),
    '_gatherpress-award'    => __( 'Awards', 'gatherpress-references' ),
)
```

**Parameters:**
- `$labels` (array) - Array of taxonomy slug => label pairs

**Example - Override existing label:**
```php
add_filter( 'gatherpress_references_type_labels', function( $labels ) {
    $labels['_gatherpress-award'] = __( 'Prizes & Honours', 'textdomain' );
    return $labels;
} );
```

**Example - Locale-specific labels:**
```php
add_filter( 'gatherpress_references_type_labels', function( $labels ) {
    $locale = get_locale();
    
    if ( $locale === 'de_DE' ) {
        $labels['_gatherpress-client'] = 'Gastspiele & Kunden';
        $labels['_gatherpress-festival'] = 'Festivals';
        $labels['_gatherpress-award'] = 'Auszeichnungen';
    }
    
    return $labels;
} );
```

### Performance Considerations

1. **Batch Queries**: Use `get_post_dates()` and `get_post_terms()` to minimize database calls
2. **Field Limitation**: Query only post IDs with `'fields' => 'ids'`
3. **Cache Management**: Automatic transient caching with smart invalidation
4. **No Found Rows**: Set `'no_found_rows' => true` to skip pagination count
5. **Term Cache**: Enable term caching with `'update_post_term_cache' => true`

### Theme.json Integration

The block fully supports WordPress theme.json:

```json
{
    "settings": {
        "blocks": {
            "gatherpress/references": {
                "color": {
                    "palette": [
                        {
                            "name": "Primary",
                            "slug": "primary",
                            "color": "#your-color"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "typography": {
                    "fontSizes": [
                        {
                            "name": "Year Heading",
                            "slug": "year-heading",
                            "size": "2.5rem"
                        }
                    ]
                },
                "spacing": {
                    "padding": true,
                    "margin": true,
                    "blockGap": true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
